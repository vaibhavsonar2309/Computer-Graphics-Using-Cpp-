# Computer-Graphics-Using-C-
In this project, I created a moving bus in the rain.

# IMP Note
  The coordinates for this project work with my screen.
  If you do not see clear views or objects, you can customize them by yourself.
  I create this project on Dev C++ IDE if you want to do this on another IDE you can use another function for the display object such as
  in Dev C++ I used initwindow(), For TurboC++ you can use initgraph().
